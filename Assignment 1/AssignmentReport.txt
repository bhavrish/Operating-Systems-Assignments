1. What form of exec() function you used? Why?

I used execlp(). The reason I chose execl over execv is because the parameters in the
exec called were fixed so the former made more sense. The next question was whether I should
use execl, execle, or execlp. I chose the final command since I did not want to to pass the full 
path names to the ls and nl commands, and execlp is the only option that allowed me to avoid passing
the full file path.

2. How many times you used fork? Why?

I used fork() twice from the parent to create the 2 child processes. That being said, I only
utilized 1 if-else block to combine both children. In the first if statement, I checked if 
either pid or pid2 (from the 2 fork commands) were less than 0, which would indicate that there
was an error when forking. In the next else-if statement, I checked if pid=0 and pid2>0, which
would mean that the program is currently executing the first child. In the subsequent
else-if statement, I checked if pid2=0 and pid>0, which would mean that the program is 
executing the second child. Lastly, in the final else statement,I checked if both pid and pid2 
are greater than 0, indicating that both children processes have finished executing and that the 
parent is now back in execution.

3. How many pipes this assignment required? Why?

This assignment required 1 pipe to connect the 2 children. The ls -F output from the first child
would redirect into fd[1] (the write end of the pipe). Afterwards, the second child would read
from fd[0] (the read end of the pipe) instead of reading from standard input. If additional commands 
were needed to execute (for ex. command1 | command2 | command3), this program would need more pipes. 
However, since this program only requried 2 children, 1 pipe was sufficient.

4. What form of wait() you used? How many times?

I used waitpid(p_id) twice. The reason for this is because the parent had to wait for both children
in the last else block. The reason why I chose this form of wait() as opposed to the traditional
wait(NULL) command is because I wanted the parent to wait for 2 specific children and thus needed to pass
the child processes' ids. The perfect command to allow me to do so was waitpid(p_id).
